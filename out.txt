23455.4243 19440 20680  What's in the box?
24509.4414 22380 23340  Whatever it is,
25522.3606 23560 23920  it must be
26865.5512 23920 24160  pretty
27930.9757 24160 24580  important
36584.3360 24580 26940  because I've traveled with it, moved
37549.0835 26940 29360  it from apartment to apartment
37903.2304 29360 36660  to apartment. Sound familiar?
40963.7449 38520 39620  Did you know
42036.4573 39620 40720  that we Americans
43032.0244 40720 41120  have
44091.9526 41120 42640  about three times
45116.3893 42640 43600  the amount of space we did
46114.7859 43600 44360  50 years ago?
48182.8241 44980 46080  Three times.
50299.8648 47280 48420  So you'd think with
51315.6111 48420 49960  all this extra space,
53423.7695 50580 51680  we'd have plenty of room for
54429.9300 51680 52660  all our stuff, right?
56603.9422 53520 53860  Nope.
59026.5169 55220 56460  There's a new industry in
59372.4198 56460 57440  town, a $22
60403.5008 57480 57900  billion,
61360.6918 58320 59980  2.2 billion square foot
62426.7955 59980 60420  industry.
64522.1736 61080 62300  that of personal storage.
65499.9418 62980 64720  So we've got triple the space.
67580.9786 64900 66040  but we've become such
73102.5321 66040 66280  good
74869.4715 66300 73140  shoppers that we need even more space. So where does this lead? Lots of credit
75952.8136 73140 73680  card debt.
77889.0445 74760 75920  huge environmental
80298.5885 75860 76340  footprints,
82245.0726 77420 80540  and perhaps not coincidentally, our happiness levels
84292.1767 80540 82660  flatline over the same 50 years.
90070.5938 83380 84860  Well, I'm here to suggest there's a better
92205.3003 84860 90760  way, that less might actually equal more. I bet most of us have experienced at some point
93140.0244 90760 91340  the joys
94146.0896 91340 92000  of less.
99434.8636 94360 94960  College,
100207.0961 95640 96280  your dorm,
101243.1805 97360 98640  traveling in a hotel
102363.0962 98620 100280  room, camping,
103347.9171 100280 101260  where you got basically
104326.1254 101260 102300  nothing, maybe a
107657.0811 102300 102540  boat.
109032.3598 103480 104560  Whatever it was for
110474.6816 104580 107760  you, I bet that among other things, this gave you a little more
112308.0039 107760 109860  freedom, a little more time.
114405.9560 112000 113060  So I want to suggest
115461.8223 113060 113860  that less
116451.1328 113860 114940  stuff and
117501.2670 114940 115140  less
118488.3866 115140 116580  space are going to equal
120614.5556 116560 118860  smaller footprint. It's actually a great way to
121747.7553 118860 119440  save you some
130302.9938 119440 122940  money and it's going to give you a little more ease in your life. So I started a
131749.6083 122940 129040  project called Life Edited at lifeedited.org to further this conversation and to find some great solutions
133167.4571 129020 129580  in this area.
134665.5700 130400 131240  First up,
136190.8300 131620 132600  crowdsourcing my
136624.7857 132600 134040  420 square foot
137689.8499 134020 135840  apartment in Manhattan with partners
138684.7768 135860 137200  Mutopo and
140727.8123 137200 139360  Jvoto.com. I wanted it all.
142854.4748 140040 140940  Home office,
143858.2439 141460 142200  sit down dinner for
144896.9221 142200 142620  10,
145948.1504 143640 144160  room for
146950.2912 144180 145360  guests, and all my
152076.1676 145360 146140  kite surfing gear.
153024.6658 146880 147220  With
161070.5779 147220 151820  over 300 entries from around the world, I got it. My own little jewel box.
162958.8513 152710 159720  By buying a space that was 420 square feet instead of 600, immediately I'm saving 200 grand.
163952.8139 160880 162580  Smaller space is going to
165031.0462 162560 163740  make for smaller utilities.
169139.0672 164120 167680  save some more money there, but also a smaller footprint.
171287.3578 168680 169600  And because it's really
172301.0652 169600 170640  designed around
173301.4851 170620 171540  an edited
174370.1510 171540 172480  set of possessions,
175415.4239 172660 173520  my favorite stuff,
176494.0069 173580 174480  and really designed for me,
177576.9081 174860 175540  I'm really excited
178730.4814 175540 176120  to be there.
180118.0079 177040 177740  So how can
181654.4533 177740 178180  you live
183200.5162 178180 180200  little? Three main approaches.
184706.1582 180740 181280  First
186109.1599 181280 184620  of all, you need to edit ruthlessly. We've got to clear the
187113.5466 184600 185680  arteries of our
188155.6187 185680 186020  lives.
189229.8841 186700 186900  And that
190213.0322 186880 188940  shirt that I haven't worn in
192310.4737 188940 190800  years, it's time for me to
193411.7136 190820 191180  let it go.
194459.7971 191800 192740  We've got to cut the
195472.1441 192740 194360  extraneous out of our lives.
197587.6317 194640 195820  and we've got to learn to
198592.6781 195820 196920  stem the
199673.0180 196920 197360  inflow.
200671.3266 198080 198680  We need to think
201841.9833 198680 199160  before we
204071.2650 199160 201780  buy. Ask ourselves, is that really
205268.7218 201780 202700  going to make me happier?
206479.4312 203300 203580  Truly?
207868.2234 204860 205800  By all means,
209542.6300 205960 206360  we should
211143.7047 206360 207540  buy and own some
212776.6685 207540 208840  great stuff.
214141.0997 208840 212740  stuff. But we want stuff that we're going to love for years, not just
215224.0250 212740 213060  stuff.
216214.2751 213600 214840  Secondly, our new
218256.4540 214860 216920  mantra, small is
219338.4163 216900 217260  sexy.
220402.4937 217860 218720  We want space
221402.6468 218720 219940  efficiency. We want things
222515.9280 219940 220740  that are designed for
223516.9516 220740 221500  how they're used the
224584.2223 221500 222720  vast majority of the
225632.8893 222720 223980  time, not
226611.3031 223980 224780  that rare
227805.8681 224780 225160  event.
228778.3377 225900 226700  Why have a six
229763.5663 226700 227940 -burner stove when you
231143.9278 227940 228720  rarely use three?
233770.2370 229580 230820  So we want things that
235288.5756 230820 231400  nest.
241459.2271 231940 234500  we want things that stack, and we want to digitize.
242931.6852 234500 240820  You can take paperwork, books, movies, and you can make it disappear. It's magic.
243968.2353 241360 242120  Finally, we want
245981.2009 242120 243360  multifunctional
247009.5222 243360 245380  spaces and housewares.
249179.4274 246080 247420  A sink combined with a toilet.
250175.1630 248000 248900  A dining table.
252170.0151 248900 250120  becomes a bed.
253289.4986 250660 251280  Same space.
254303.8552 251840 252200  A little
255358.3722 252200 253480  side table stretches
256336.0679 253480 254140  out to seat
257459.9249 254140 254640  10.
258529.5157 255440 256420  In the winning life
259937.5837 256440 257580 -edited scheme, in a
261408.3979 257580 258120  render here,
262877.6309 258280 259320  we combine a moving
264412.2806 259320 261020  wall with transformer furniture
265906.2693 261020 262780  to get a lot out of the space.
267439.8572 262780 264140  Look at the coffee table.
267799.8068 265040 266000  It grows in
268796.1352 266000 267520  height and width to
269826.7353 267520 268040  seat 10.
271872.7496 269200 270400  My office folds
272878.8052 270400 270720  away,
273915.8792 271260 271980  easily hidden.
274962.3079 272640 272840  My
275990.5047 272840 274280  bed just pops out of the
277057.6963 274280 275260  wall, two fingers.
279096.7801 276300 277520  Guests move
280173.6813 277520 277920  the moving
281180.6226 277920 279580  wall, have some fold-down
282185.8976 279580 280140  guest beds.
283297.0810 280920 281560  And of course,
284308.5775 281820 282320  my own
285435.5614 282320 282780  movie theater.
286454.4675 283800 284600  So I'm not saying
287528.8453 284600 285760  that we all need to live
288620.3547 285760 286020  in
289833.7359 286020 287060  420 square
291039.8855 287060 289100  feet, but consider the benefits of
292447.6318 289100 289840  an edited life.
295869.5674 291000 292480  Go from 3,000 to 2
296939.5008 292480 294980 ,000. From 1,500 to 1,000.
297983.4929 295640 296180  Most of
299044.9007 296200 297520  us, maybe all of us,
300083.9884 297560 298320  are here pretty
301185.2283 298340 299420  happily for a bunch of
303176.9328 299420 300640  days with a couple
304235.5540 300640 301620  bags, maybe
305285.8644 301620 302920  small space, hotel room.
306346.3323 303680 304160  So when you go
307362.8879 304160 305760  home and you walk through your front door,
309537.6594 306580 307580  take a second and ask
310704.2451 307580 308040  yourselves,
311874.4714 308860 309600  could I do with a little
313157.8879 309600 310200  life editing?
314534.0700 310700 312160  Would that give me a little more freedom?
316165.3965 312820 313520  Maybe a little more
317514.7028 313520 314040  time?
320386.6436 314040 318260  freedom? What's in the box?
322421.9472 319880 321420  It doesn't really matter.
324495.2857 322740 323280  I know
325496.8808 323280 323940  I don't need it.
328547.7061 326140 327060  What's in yours?
331665.9577 328260 329620  Maybe, just maybe,
332669.7497 330020 331260  less might equal more.
334737.7150 332300 333080  So let's make
336787.2281 333080 335080  room for the good stuff.
338834.9621 336340 337040  Thank you.
351558.8417 337040 337540  Thank you.
