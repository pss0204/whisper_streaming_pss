33627.0456 22280 23220  Whatever it is.
35059.0267 23560 24160  it must be pretty
35591.1641 24160 30300  important, because I've traveled with it, moved it, from apartment to apartment to apartment.
37779.1569 35680 36660  Sound familiar?
40756.6371 39080 39620  Did you know
41415.7307 39620 39840  that
50365.0606 39840 40700  we Americans
52789.1557 40700 49980  have about three times the amount of space we did 50 years ago? Three times. So you'd think with all this extra space,
53168.9129 50600 51680  we'd have plenty of room for
53553.2072 51680 52660  all our stuff, right?
54812.0534 53560 53860  Nope.
57214.4608 55480 55860  There's
57836.9007 55860 56480  a new industry in
58442.8089 56480 57000  town, a
59066.4377 57000 58420  22 billion dollar company.
61077.8775 58340 59980  2.2 billion square foot
61757.0982 59980 60380  industry.
63257.4668 61080 61340  that
64158.1478 61340 62280  of personal storage.
65028.0728 63060 63260  So
65878.9275 63260 64740  we've got triple the space.
67761.7440 64920 66040  but we've become such
68731.9725 66040 66880  good shoppers.
70851.1639 67540 69520  that we need even more space.
73242.6660 70260 70940  So where
74794.3025 70920 71540  does this lead?
76316.9079 72380 73140  Lots of credit
77788.8062 73140 73400  card
78177.1922 73420 75940  debt, huge environmental
78518.8112 75900 77680  footprints, and
78846.2288 77680 78480  perhaps
79558.8458 78440 78800  not
79908.0434 78820 79340  coincidentally,
80711.7095 79640 79740  our
81131.4652 79740 80080  happiness
82039.7670 80100 80560  levels
82533.7408 80540 81560  flatline
82991.0142 81540 82020  over the same
83451.2744 82020 82620  50 years.
85156.5166 83160 84020  Well, I'm here to
85782.5723 84020 84680  suggest there's a
86463.5956 84680 85160  better way.
87894.8178 85640 86220  That less
88616.9727 86220 87560  might actually equal more.
90302.0301 88420 88640  I
91176.0511 88640 89420  bet most of us
92082.9599 89420 90160  have experienced
92986.9964 90160 90940  at some point the
93878.5281 90940 92000  joys of less.
98497.1330 94360 95920  College, your
99823.1211 95920 96260  dorm,
101207.4513 97320 98960  traveling in a hotel room,
102550.5080 99780 100140  camping,
103961.3895 100640 101260  where you've got basically
104293.3950 101260 102540  nothing, maybe a boat.
105357.4464 103360 104800  Whatever it was for you,
106264.3108 105160 105500  I bet
106692.2402 105500 105640  that
107197.7503 105620 106060  among other
107722.2373 106060 106460  things,
108233.0813 106880 107360  this gave you
108733.9861 107380 108140  a little more freedom.
110417.0244 109120 109540  a little more
111013.8419 109520 109880  time.
114097.5385 111960 113060  So I want to suggest
114803.0696 113060 113400  that
115512.7151 113380 114280  less stuff,
117010.5376 114280 115580  and less space
117805.4922 115580 116560  are going to equal
119462.3477 116540 117560  smaller footprint.
120376.2858 117960 118860  It's actually a great way to
121431.0577 118860 119440  save you some
122453.3138 119440 120400  money and it's
126248.3816 120380 123500  gonna give you a little more ease in your life. So I started a project called
127787.0722 123500 123760  Life
129337.2409 123760 125440  Edited at lifeedited.org
131027.3616 125440 127820  to further this conversation and to
131479.1818 127840 129580  find some great solutions in this area.
132344.4030 130340 130940  First
132740.3064 130940 132320  up, crowdsourcing.
